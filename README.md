  Let me start by saying, I am not sure how I stumbled upon this but I googled the right thing. I wanted to make sure to cite this reference in helping me with this challenge. I do want to note that I used it only when I could not figure something out as I wanted to figure it out on my own and I used it as a reference to make sure I was on the right track. I used this source to help me with yearly change (where I struggled the most) to get the code to subtract the first open amount of the ticker from the close amount of the same ticker. Also helped me to figure out to use a new last row for the ticker table to help create the second table and color coding area. I originally tried to use my original lastrow but then I had color all the way down to the last row of the original data.
